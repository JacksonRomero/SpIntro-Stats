gettysbrg <- "   Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

    Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

    But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before usâ€”that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

joke <- "Four college friends were so confident that the weekend before finals, they decided to go to a
city several hours away to party with some friends. They had a great time. However, after all
the partying, they slept all day Sunday and didnt make it back to school until early Monday
morning.
Rather than taking the final then, they decided to find their professor after the final and explain
to him why they missed it.
They explained that they had gone to the city for the weekend with the plan to come back
and study but, unfortunately, they had a flat tire on the way back, didnt have a spare, and
couldnt get help for a long time. As a result, they missed the final.
The professor thought it over and then agreed they could make up the final the following day.
The four were elated and relieved.
They studied that night and went in the next day at the time the professor had told them.
The professor placed them in separate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet, and told them to
begin.
They looked at the first problem, worth 5 points. It was something simple about exploratory
data analysis. 'Cool,' they thought at the same time, each one in his separate room. 'This is
going to be easy.'
Each finished the problem and then turned the page. On the second page was written:
For 95 points: Which tire?"
