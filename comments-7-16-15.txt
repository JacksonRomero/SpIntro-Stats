Hi Allison,

 Nice progress!
 
Perhaps we shouldn't use a default value for H_0.
Pedagogically, making them choose a value is good.
It's weird that when I change it to another value, shuffle, and "Count Points",
 it immediately goes back to 0.5. Perhaps there is a setting to hold
 the input. 

 
Can we make the width smaller on null_p textInput box?
And make label and input box on the same line (like the count points
below the plot) instead of in 2 lines?


The "Count Points" computation needs some work.  Maybe the count is
OK, but the plot is not changing colors properly. Colors are confused and the
color does not get reset to blue when I change the selection.

 What should happen if I say I want points more extreme than 0.20 when
 p_0 = 0.40?

The last output line should be blank until the select a region, right?

Looking good,

Jim
