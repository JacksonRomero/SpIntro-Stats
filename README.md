### Repo of Course materials for Stat 216, Fall 2015 ###
 at Montana State University

*  In three units  
   1)  Hypothesis test and CI for 1 proportion with a bit of sampling  
       via simulation and bootstrap  
   2)  Hyp Test and CI's for more situations:  
       compare 2 proportions, compare 2 means, test/estimate slope  
   3)  Use normal and t distributions as approximations to the permutation &  
       bootstrap above. Cover all the same types of inference.  
  

### LaTeX code requires a full LaTeX setup ###

* Packages:  
  letterpaper, amsmath, amssymb, graphicx, ifthen, comment, natbib, color, fancyhdr, hyperref, pdflatex

*  Brief instructions:

  cd to coursePack directory  
  pdflatex TR-coursePack.tex  

  That automatically includes the files it needs like U1-D1.tex for unit 1, day 1, on down to U3-D28.tex.  
   We also included some pages from Open Intro book.  

### Known issues:  
  We have developed these activities over the last two years at MSU
  and have used them extensively in Stat216 (Intro Stats) meeting
  twice a week for 75 minutes each time.  This fall we are also using
  them in the same class with a different schedule: meeting MWF for 50
  minutes each. We expect some issues at getting them to fit.  In
  fact, some of the original activities went long in the 75 minute
  classes as well.  One purpose of this repository is to provide a
  discussion platform to discuss what work, what doesn't, and how
  these could be improved.  

### Companion site:  
  We have written our own web apps which are used in most of these activities.
