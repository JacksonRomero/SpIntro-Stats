### Repo of Course materials for Stat 216, Fall 2015 ###
 at Montana State University

*  Three units

### LaTeX code requires a full LaTeX setup ###

* Packages:  
  letterpaper, amsmath, amssymb, graphicx, ifthen, comment, natbib, color, fancyhdr, hyperref, pdflatex

* cd to TR-F2015/coursePack directory  
  pdflatex TR-coursePack.tex  

  That automatically includes the files it needs like U1-D1.tex for unit 1, day 1, on down to U3-D28.tex.

### Known issues:  
  We have developed these activities over the last two years at MSU and have used them extensively in Stat216 (Intro Stats) meeting twice a week for 75 minutes each time.  This fall we are also using them in the same class with a different schedule: meeting MWF for 50 minutes each. We expect some issues at getting them to fit.  In fact, the original activities do not all fit well in the 75 minute classes as well.  One purpose of this repository is to provide a discussion platform to discuss what work, what doesn't, and how these could be improved.

### Companion site:  
  We have written our own web apps which are used in most of these activities.
