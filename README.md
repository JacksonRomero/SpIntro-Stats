# IntroStatShinyApps
Web Apps built in R/Shiny to provide permutation tests and bootstrap confidence intervals for use in Intro Stat class.

We are now teaching introductory statistics at Montana State
University using active learning lessons which get students right
into permutation tests and bootstrap confidence intervals very early
in the course.  

This repo is intended to build and share R/Shiny web apps to automate
permutation testing and bootstrapping.  

We will include some descriptive statistics and plots.  

Also, at the end of the course, normal and t distribution methods will
be used as short cut approximations of the simulation based
inference.  

__TODO:__

 * Data input - use a form for 1 and 2 categorical variables.  
  Other types get a choice:  
     select existing data frame,   
     Upload a local csv file,  
     type or copy into a table using rhandsontable  
 
 * Descriptive stats and plots
     OK for 1 and 2 categorical variables.  

 * Permutation Tests:  
   one proportion  
   equality of two proportions  
   one mean  
   equality of two means  
   correlation and slope  
   
 * Bootstrap CI's for the same settings.
